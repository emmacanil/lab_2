# GEOS 472: Lab 2

### Collaborations and reliance on other resources:
I utilized a few different coding resources in the making of this map including Mapbox tutorials and GitHub documentation of some functions. The tutorial resources I used from Mapbox tutorials included the ‘Analyze data with Turf.js and Mapbox.js’ tutorial to import and symbolize the points of hospitals on the map. In terms of the interactivity of the map, I used the ‘Build a store locator using Mapbox GL JS’ tutorial to code the function that locates the nearest hospital as well as to organize the list of hospitals on the side-bar when a user inputs their address in the search bar.

### Reflective analysis: 
The audience for which I designed this map is the British Columbia Health Authority and their respective audiences. The need this map attempts in addressing is to locate the nearest hospital to the user’s given and selected address. This map could also serve the need of healthcare workers to find the distance to the nearest hospital in the situation of a medical emergency. My map is successful in this attempt as when the user inputs an address, the map returns the point of the address the user inputted and the point location of the nearest hospital to them. At the same time, when a user selects their address through the search bar, the map re-organizes a list of hospitals sorted by their distance to the point the user has selected.

The process I followed in terms of design and interactivity of this map is I created a base map on Mapbox and imported this map into p5.js to add the points of hospital data and interactive elements to this map. My data for this map comes from the British Columbia Health Authorities Geographies Portal and in this map, I included the name, coordinates, and address of the hospital in my data for the map. I chose these data variables for the hospitals as the main goal of this map was to locate a map, in which the coordinates served for this), as well as to make the user experience easier, I included the name of the hospital as well as its address. The base layer I used in this map was the Mapbox ‘Street’ layer. Because this map functions as a navigational tool, I included street names as well as the default symbology in this base layer to serve as a locational context in terms of where the hospitals are located. 

My initial goal with this map was to also return a line of directions from the user’s selected address to the nearest hospital but was not able to find a way in achieving this. This is one of the ways the map could be improved. Another way in which a map can be improved is to configure the map in a way that its functionality fits into the view and use on a mobile device. In times of emergencies, usually, the quickest and easiest way to locate a hospital is through a mobile device as it is readily available to a large proportion of the population.
